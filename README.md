Emotional Comprehension in AI: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT and Gemini Empathic Features, explores the ability of two state-of-the-art AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, to comprehend and express emotions. The study focuses on their capacity to classify neutral statements into six emotional categories—joyful, sad, confident, afraid, angry, and caring—and their empathic response to these emotions. By analyzing the accuracy and depth of their responses, this project sheds light on the emotional intelligence of AI systems and highlights their potential applications in enhancing human-computer interaction, mental health support, and empathetic technologies. The findings contribute to advancing emotionally intelligent AI systems capable of fostering meaningful and compassionate user interactions.
